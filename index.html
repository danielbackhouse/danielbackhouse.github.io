          <p>I am an engineering physics student with a keen interest in implementing software and electrical engineering. My main role on this robot was working with the microcontrollers to figure out the firmware including port manipulation and timer controls, communication between microcontrollers, and also a major contributor  to the electrical circuit design/troubleshooting. Building this robot provided me with a newly discovered interest in low-level programming and firmware implementation, as well as  electrical circuit design.

                </div><br>
            <p>STEV-E failed to score a single point come competition time, placing him in last place. At 6am our robot became unable to follow tape and became unresponsive to input from any of its sensors.</p>
            
            <h3>The Malfunctioning Component</h3>
            <p>The malfunctioning component on competition day was the I2C communication between the blue pills. The master blue pills inability to communicate with the slave meant that all sensors, including those used for tape following, were rendered useless and the master was unable to receive input or send output to the slave. </p>
            <h3>Point of Weakness</h3>
            <p>Our point of failure, above all else, was a lack of design iteration. Our robot was one of the first to be completed and was also the first robot to successfully pickup and dump three Ewoks. However, the speed we progressed at came at the cost of an increasingly poor design. We started with our initial design, but as we realized the need for more components and sensors as well as fixes to the initial design, we simply began attaching and modifying the existing robot. As a result, STEV-E became increasingly messy. This left us vulnerable to problems in reliability which ultimately came back to haunt us. The faulty communication between the master and slave blue pills on competition day was simply a consequence of this. </p>
